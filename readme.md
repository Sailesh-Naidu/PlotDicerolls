# Create interactive visualizations using Plotly

When you roll one regular, six-sided die, you have an equal chance of rolling any of the
numbers from 1 through 6. However, when you use two dice, you’re more
likely to roll certain numbers than others. We’ll try to determine which
numbers are most likely to occur by generating a dataset that represents
rolling dice. Then we’ll plot the results of a large number of rolls to determine
which results are more likely than others.
